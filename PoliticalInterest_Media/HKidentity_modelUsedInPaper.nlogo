;; Model for paper on our algorithm of agent's identity cognition
;; RQ: How does identity improves classical HK model?
;;
;; NOTES:
;; This code focuses on dis/proving the identity advances HK significantly,
;; we stick with Hegselmann-Krausse model as much as possible:
;; we stay in just 1D,
;; we are able to use 101 HK agents in same step differences from one pole to another,
;; we are able to use also the opinion value from the end of previous round.
;; Then we advancing HK:
;; we relax classical conditions mentioned above,
;; we generate uncertainty/boundary and conformity as random normal
;; we add identity in three modes: global, individual and covert

## THINGS TO NOTICE

(suggested things for the user to notice while running the model)

## THINGS TO TRY

(suggested things for the user to try to do (move sliders, switches, etc.) with the model)

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

(suggested things to add or change in the Code tab to make the model more complicated, detailed, accurate, etc.)

## NETLOGO FEATURES

(interesting or unusual features of NetLogo that the model uses, particularly in the Code tab; or where workarounds were needed for missing features)

## RELATED MODELS

(models in the NetLogo Models Library and elsewhere which are of related interest)

## CREDITS AND REFERENCES
